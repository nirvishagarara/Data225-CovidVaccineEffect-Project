# Data225-CovidVaccineEffect-Project
Covid-19 vaccines' adverse effect analysis for Data 225-Database Management for data Analytics Final Project.
COVID-19 is spread by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (CoronaVirus Infectious Disease-19). In December of 2019, the first case was identified. The COVID-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc on people all over the world right now. Because of the virus’s scope and magnitude, as well as the lack of a clear clinical range, vaccine development has accelerated at an exponential pace.Vaccine portals and methods are being studied in a variety of ways. The aim of our investigation is to figure out which vaccine caused the most harm, which age demographic was most affected by the vaccine’s side effects, and how vaccination affects patients who are already infected.
